Overview
---

Hungry Hero is an open source Flash game built on [__Starling Framework__](http://www.gamua.com/starling).

This game is built to give developers an idea of how a typical Starling based game looks like.
The basic idea is to showcase how easy it is to build a Stage3D game, giving your games the 
power of GPU rendering or Hardware acceleration.

Some of the features & highlights this game showcases: -

* Textures
* Animation
  * Using GreenSock's [TweenLite](http://www.greensock.com/) Library
	* Using Juggler in Starling Framework
* Texture Atlas or Sprite Sheets
* Parallax Background
* Mouse/Touch Interaction
* Collision/Hit Detection
* Object Pooling
* Bitmap Fonts
* Starling Extension: [Particle System](https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Extension-Particle-System)

Though this project is developed considering the size of Apple iPad 1 & 2, with basic changes to the configuration files, it can be made to run on any device that supports Adobe AIR/Flash and is developed with "One code, multi-screen" in mind.
